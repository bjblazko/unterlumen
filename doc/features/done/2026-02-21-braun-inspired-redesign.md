# Braun-Inspired Visual Redesign

*Last modified: 2026-02-21*

## Summary

Redesign the application's visual language following Dieter Rams' ten principles of good design, drawing from the aesthetic of Braun products of the 1960s–80s.

## Details

### Color palette

- Off-white background (#f5f2ed) reminiscent of Braun product housings
- Warm dark gray for primary text (#3a3a3a)
- Medium gray for secondary text (#7a7a7a)
- Light warm gray for borders and dividers (#e0dcd5)
- Functional orange (#d35400) for active states and primary actions — referencing Braun's use of orange accents
- Clean white (#ffffff) for card surfaces

### Typography

- System sans-serif stack (closest to Helvetica, which Braun used extensively)
- Restrained size scale: 12px secondary, 13px body, 14px labels, 16px headings
- Medium weight for hierarchy, no bold decorative text

### Controls

- Simple, understated buttons with thin borders
- No gradients, no heavy shadows
- Active/selected states use the orange accent
- Labels preferred over icons — controls should be self-explanatory

### Layout

- Generous whitespace on an 8px grid
- Photos presented without ornament — no drop shadows, no decorative borders
- Grid items on clean white cards with minimal separation
- Viewer: maximum space for the image, minimal toolbar

### Simplifications

- Warning banners: clean, understated amber on warm background
- Breadcrumbs: simple path with restrained color
- Scrollbars: thin, unobtrusive

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Light theme with warm off-white background
- [x] Orange accent for active states and primary actions
