# Sorting

*Last modified: 2026-02-21*

## Summary

Sort directory entries by name or date, in ascending or descending order.

## Details

### Sort fields

- **Name** — case-insensitive alphabetical sort on the filename
- **Date** — sort by date taken (EXIF `DateTimeOriginal` for JPEGs) or filesystem modification time as fallback

### Sort order

- **Ascending** (default) — A-Z or oldest-first
- **Descending** — Z-A or newest-first

### Directory ordering

Directories always sort before image files regardless of the chosen sort field or order.

### UI controls

- A dropdown selects the sort field (Name / Date)
- A toggle button shows the current order (↑ for ascending, ↓ for descending)
- Changing either control reloads the directory listing with the new sort applied
- Both browse mode and each commander pane have independent sort controls

### API

- `GET /api/browse?path=...&sort=name|date&order=asc|desc`
- Sorting is performed server-side before returning the JSON response

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Sort by name works case-insensitively
- [x] Sort by date uses EXIF date when available
- [x] Ascending and descending order both work
- [x] Directories always appear before images
- [x] Sort state is independent per pane in commander mode
- [x] Default is name ascending
